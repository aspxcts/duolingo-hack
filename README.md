# duolingo-hack
A hack for duolingo using the easyocr python library for text recognition and the mymemory api for translation

THIS IS AN EXTREMELY UNRELIABLE WAY OF ANSWERING QUESTIONS
currently the chance the bot gets question wrong is like 30%
until I fix all the bugs and make good failsafes, dont try to run this
if you do make the mistake of running this, and the bot goes rouge, slam your mouse in any corner, and the program will instantly stop
  
+added the openai library to check if a sentence makes sense or not

// code now requires an active openai paid api key cause i failed at making a ML algorithm to recognize if a sentence makes sense or not

WARNING: 
this module is very heavy on your cpu if you dont have an nvidia graphics card with CUDA or MPS installed.
