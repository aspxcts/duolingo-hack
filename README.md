# duolingo-hack
A hack for duolingo using the easyocr python library for text recognition and the mymemory api for translation
+added the openai library to check if a sentence makes sense or not

// code now requires an active openai paid api key cause i failed at making a ML algorithm to recognize if a sentence makes sense or not

WARNING: 
this module is very heavy on your cpu if you dont have an nvidia graphics card with CUDA installed.
